goal: "Port PrintingMagic.Worker scraping pipeline into a standalone .NET 9 Aspire-registered background service using Microsoft.Playwright headless browser automation, baselining from the reference codebase"
key_decisions:
  - Microsoft.Playwright (.NET) as the headless browser — same as reference, avoids new technology risk
  - Isolated project PrintingMagic.Scraper rather than embedding in Worker or ApiService
  - Aspire registration via aspire CLI (aspire add), not manual AppHost csproj edit
  - Credentials injected via Aspire environment variables / connection strings — no hardcoded values
  - All data writes routed through IInternalApiClient — no direct database access from the scraper
  - Shared browser session pattern (BrowserSessionService singleton) preserved from reference
open_questions:
  - Does PrintingMagic.Data.Contracts exist in the new solution? If not, create a minimal DTO project before scraper build.
  - Playwright browser binary provisioning strategy for Aspire Dockerfile vs local dev (playwright install vs bundled binary)
  - Is the internal API base URL injected via Aspire service discovery or explicit configuration?

# Tech Plan: newversion-scraper-scraper-scaffolding

## Technical Summary

The scraper is a .NET 9 `BackgroundService`-based worker project (`PrintingMagic.Scraper`) that ports the authenticated web-scraping pipeline from `PrintingMagic.Worker` (oldversion reference codebase) into a standalone, first-class Aspire resource. It uses Microsoft.Playwright (headless Chromium, .NET bindings) to authenticate against the STLFlix web UI, discover all drop/collection pages, extract collection and model metadata, and hand the result to a local `IInternalApiClient` for storage. The project is registered in the Aspire AppHost using the `aspire add` CLI command and receives credentials and configuration at runtime through Aspire environment injection. No new scraping technology is introduced — the baseline is the validated reference implementation.

## Architecture Overview

```
Aspire AppHost (PrintingMagic.Aspire)
│
├── PrintingMagic.ApiService      (existing — HTTP target for scraped data)
│
└── PrintingMagic.Scraper         (NEW — this feature)
      ├── Worker (BackgroundService loop, 5-min cycle)
      │     ├── BrowserSessionService (singleton Playwright session + login)
      │     ├── DropProcessingService (discover + scrape all unprocessed drops)
      │     └── CollectionHarvesterJob (scrape → IExternalScraper → IInternalApiClient)
      │
      ├── Scrapers/
      │     └── StlflixScraper : IExternalScraper
      │           └── (Playwright page navigation, selector-based extraction)
      │
      └── IInternalApiClient / InternalApiClient
            └── HTTP → PrintingMagic.ApiService (Aspire service discovery URL)
```

**Components affected:** PrintingMagic.Aspire (AppHost — gains a new resource reference)

**Integration points:**
- Aspire AppHost: `aspire add` registers the scraper project; Aspire injects OTEL endpoint and service URLs
- PrintingMagic.ApiService: ingestion endpoint (POST `/import/collection`, POST `/import/model`) — same contract as reference
- STLFlix web platform: outbound Playwright HTTP via `platform.stlflix.com`

## Design Decisions (ADRs)

### ADR-1: Microsoft.Playwright as the headless browser

**Decision:** Use Microsoft.Playwright (.NET) for headless browser automation.

**Rationale:** The reference codebase uses Playwright successfully in production. It provides reliable authenticated session management, stable selector APIs, and .NET 9 compatibility. Switching to a different browser automation library introduces unvalidated risk and rewrite effort.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- `PuppeteerSharp` — fewer .NET-native APIs, less alignment with the reference implementation
- `Selenium` — heavier, requires external WebDriver server, no advantage over Playwright for this use case
- HTTP API scraping — STLFlix does not expose a documented API; web UI scraping is the only available approach

### ADR-2: Isolated `PrintingMagic.Scraper` project

**Decision:** The scraper lives in its own project, not embedded in `PrintingMagic.Worker` or `PrintingMagic.ApiService`.

**Rationale:** Aspire service isolation and the single-responsibility principle. A separate project allows independent deployment, independent scaling, and independent configuration. It also mirrors the Aspire architecture pattern.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Embedding in ApiService — violates separation of concerns; API service should not run background browser sessions
- Single Worker project combining scraper + model automation — the oldversion Worker was a known source of coupling; new version separates these explicitly

### ADR-3: Register via `aspire add`

**Decision:** Register `PrintingMagic.Scraper` in the AppHost using `aspire add PrintingMagic.Scraper`.

**Rationale:** The user explicitly requested Aspire CLI integration. `aspire add` generates the correct project reference and resource builder call in `apphost.cs` without manual csproj editing, reducing human error.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Manual `apphost.cs` edit — error-prone; bypasses Aspire's own project reference tooling

### ADR-4: Credentials via Aspire environment injection

**Decision:** `Stlflix:Email` and `Stlflix:Password` are injected as Aspire environment variables, not hardcoded.

**Rationale:** Security. The reference codebase had a default email hardcoded as a fallback — this is removed in the new version. Credentials are supplied at runtime via Aspire's connection string / environment mechanism and optionally stored in user secrets for local dev.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Hardcoded fallback credentials — violates OWASP A02:2021 (Cryptographic Failures / secrets in code)
- Config file only — config files may be committed accidentally; Aspire environment injection is preferred

### ADR-5: All data writes through IInternalApiClient

**Decision:** The scraper never writes directly to the database. All scraped data is submitted via `IInternalApiClient` to `PrintingMagic.ApiService`.

**Rationale:** Maintains the same architectural boundary as the reference. The API service owns the data model; the scraper is a pure harvesting agent.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Direct EF Core / database writes from scraper — creates tightly coupled dependency on data layer; bypasses API validation

## API Contracts

### Outbound: STLFlix web platform (via Playwright)

No formal contract. Navigation targets:
- `https://platform.stlflix.com/sign-in` — authentication
- `https://platform.stlflix.com/drops` — drop discovery
- Per-drop URLs discovered dynamically during scraping

**Breaking change:** false (the scraper reads from STLFlix; it does not expose an inbound API)

### Inbound → PrintingMagic.ApiService (unchanged from reference)

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| `/import/collection` | POST | `CollectionImportRequest` | Array of `CollectionSeed` (title + model URLs) |
| `/import/model` | POST | `ModelImportDto` | (id, empty strings in reference — may be extended) |

**Breaking change:** false — no new endpoints; existing contract reused

## Data Model Changes

No new tables or schema changes. The scraper produces `CollectionImportRequest` → `CollectionSeed[]` → posted to the API service. The API service owns all persistence.

**Schema alignment check required (open question):** Verify `PrintingMagic.Data.Contracts` DTO shapes in new solution match old version before integration.

## Dependencies

- `Microsoft.Playwright` NuGet — headless browser bindings
- `Microsoft.Playwright.MSTest` or equivalent — for selector-level tests
- `PrintingMagic.Data.Contracts` — DTO project (must exist or be created before sprint 1 completes)
- Aspire AppHost project (`newversion-apphost-scaffolding`) — must be registered before Aspire resource registration
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` — `BackgroundService` base class
- `OpenTelemetry.*` — OTEL SDK packages for Aspire telemetry integration

## Rollout Strategy

**Phase:** Local dev only → confirm scraper runs and Aspire shows it healthy.  
**Feature flag:** None needed (it is a new, additive service with no existing callers).  
**Canary:** Not applicable at this stage.  
**Rollback plan:** If the Aspire resource causes AppHost instability, remove the resource from `apphost.cs` (revert the `aspire add` registration) and delete the `PrintingMagic.Scraper` project reference. No data rollback needed — the scraper only posts to the API; it does not own any tables.

## Testing Strategy

| Level | Scope | Approach |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Unit | `StlflixScraper` selectors | Page fixture HTML + Playwright test harness; assert URLs and titles extracted correctly |
| Unit | `BrowserSessionService` | Mock `IPlaywright`; assert re-login triggered on session invalidation |
| Unit | `CollectionHarvesterJob` | Mock `IExternalScraper` + `IInternalApiClient`; assert concurrency gate (SemaphoreSlim(5)) is respected |
| Integration | Full scrape cycle | Single cycle against live STLFlix (dev credentials); assert `CollectionImportRequest` is non-empty and API posts succeed |
| Aspire smoke test | Service starts | Aspire AppHost launches; `PrintingMagic.Scraper` resource reaches `Running` state with no startup exceptions |

## Observability

Following the reference codebase `ActivitySource` pattern:

```csharp
private static readonly ActivitySource s_activitySource = new("PrintingMagic.Scraper");
```

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Traces | `ActivitySource` spans on `ExecuteAsync`, `ProcessDropsAsync`, `ScrapeAsync`, `LoginAsync`, `GetBrowserAsync` |
| Logs | Structured `ILogger<T>` logs at Info/Warning/Error — same log points as reference |
| Metrics | Aspire default resource metrics (CPU, memory) — no custom counters in scope for this sprint |
| Alerts | None in scope — operator monitors Aspire dashboard |

## Open Questions

1. **Data.Contracts project** — Does `PrintingMagic.Data.Contracts` exist in the new solution? If not, it must be created as a minimal DTO project in sprint 1 before `CollectionImportRequest` and related types can be referenced.
2. **Playwright browser binary provisioning** — For containerized Aspire deployment, `playwright install chromium` must run as part of the container image build. Strategy for local dev: `playwright install` post-project-restore hook vs. manual step?
3. **Internal API URL** — Is `PrintingMagic.ApiService` URL injected via Aspire service discovery (`http+http://apiservice`) or a hardcoded config value? Aspire service discovery is preferred.
